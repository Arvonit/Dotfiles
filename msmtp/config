# Set default values for all following accounts.
defaults

# Always use TLS.
tls on

# Set a list of trusted CAs for TLS. The default is to use system settings, but
# you can select your own file.
#tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

# Host name of the SMTP server
host smtp.fastmail.com

# Fastmail SMTP port
port 465

# As an alternative to tls_trust_file, you can use tls_fingerprint
# to pin a single certificate. You have to update the fingerprint when the
# server certificate changes, but an attacker cannot trick you into accepting
# a fraudulent certificate. Get the fingerprint with
# $ msmtp --serverinfo --tls --tls-certcheck=off --host=smtp.freemail.example
#tls_fingerprint 00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11:22:33

# Envelope-from address
from me@arvind.dev

# Authentication. The password is given using one of five methods, see below.
auth on
user me@arvind.dev

# Fastmail doesn't use SMARTTLS, so let's disable it
tls_starttls off

# Password method 1: Add the password to the system keyring, and let msmtp get
# it automatically.
# This is what we are using.

# Set a default account
